# InventoryManagement System
This application will keep a high inventory turnover ratio to ensure the products aren’t spoiling, becoming obsolete for working capital.
In this project, I developed a complete back-end software in which we can update the stock, modify stock, forecast the stock, and generate invoices.
From this application, we can get an update on if a particular inventory or stock is less than the pre-fixed quantity then it’ll be easy for the manager/owner to reorder the product from the supplier to overcome the “Out of Stock” stage.
In addition to this, it can also help us to manage the warehouses, and add warehouses which can be proved a very useful feature.
We can have complete customer details which can help us to retrieve the order details of regular customers.
From this program, we can also keep track of transactions performed by different customers/clients. We can also get an idea of how much funds we received from different payment methodologies.
This application will keep a high inventory turnover ratio to ensure our products aren’t spoiling, or becoming obsolete for our working capital. It’ll help us to calculate how many times inventory sells in a year and see where we can make better use of our resources.
    
# Purpose:
INVENTORY MANAGEMENT must tie together the following objectives to ensure that there is continuity between functions :
• Company’s Strategic Goals
• Sales Forecasting
• Sales & Operations Planning
• Production & Materials Requirement Planning.

Inventory Management must be designed to meet the dictates of market place and support the company’s Strategic Plan. The many changes in the market demand , new opportunities due to worldwide marketing, global sourcing of materials, and new manufacturing technology mean many companies need to change their Inventory Management approach and change the process for Inventory Control.

Inventory Management system provides information to efficiently manage the flow of materials, effectively utilize people and equipment, coordinate internal activities, and communicate with customers. Inventory Management does not make decisions or manage operations, it provides the information to managers who make more accurate and timely decisions to manage their operations.

INVENTORY is defined as the blocked Working Capital of an organization in the form of materials. As this is the blocked Working Capital of the organization, ideally it should be zero. But we are maintaining Inventory. This Inventory is maintained to take care of fluctuations in demand and lead time. In some cases, it is maintained to take care of the increasing price tendency of commodities or rebates in bulk buying.

# SCOPE:
1. This will help us maintain the exact count of any product.
2. Can help us to set the minimum quantity of any product below which we can order the product from manufacturer.
3. Can reduce duplicate entries

# Implementation
In this project, I’ve only implemented the back end of the system which is designed on “SQL Plus”
On this sequence query language, we created 10 tables named:
1. Brands
2. inv_user
3. Categories
4. Products
5. Stores
6. Providers
7. Customer_cart
8. Select_product
9. Transaction
10. Invoice
